MapJam Project 

This project is intended to automate the process of information aggregation for sharing services in the Tampa Bay, FL area. This is part of the larger #MapJam Civic Coding effort.

We are currently developing these key functional components:

Data collection for sharing services within geofence for Tampa Bay
Template for data based on localwiki.org page format
Populating template, duplicate check, data verification and automated updates

Updates are coming soon!
